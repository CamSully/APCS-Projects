My projects for the 2016 Advanced Placement Computer Science course.

The AP Computer Science course was an online high school class, managed by the organization AP4ALL.
My class began at the beginning of my senior year of high school (September 2015), and concluded with the AP Test on May 3rd, 2016.
Each week, I was assigned to read several sections of the Blue Pelican Java textbook, and then I took a quiz and completed a project to ensure understanding of the material.
This repository includes each project I completed for APCS.
Note that all projects are in Java, and these projects are meant to be used with the BlueJ IDE.
This course taught me Java fundimentals and problem-solving that will assist me in future coding. I appreciate the opportunity to take the online course.
Enjoy the code!
