PROJECT TITLE: Shuffle Simulator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To allow the user to shuffle decks of cards in two different ways.
VERSION or DATE: 2016.3.26
AUTHOR: Cameron Sullivan
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To learn about this project, run the main method.

Comments on main method execution:
	When running the main method, I noticed that the 'perfect' shuffle was in my opinion ineffective in randomly shuffling the cards.
	This was because it always shuffled the cards in the exact same way every time. Also, I didn't like how it placed the first
	26 cards on even indices, and the last 26 cards on odd indices. This is a very structured way of shuffling cards, it isn't
	random.
	The effecient selection shuffle was much better at randomly shuffling the cards, for two reasons. First, because it used true
	randomization, the shuffled decks weren't the same every time. Also, the cards were much more randomly mixed within each other.
	There was no real discernable pattern among them. While this algorithm would take a long time in real life, it is a fast, effective
	shuffling method for a computer.
